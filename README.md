This app is made for CARMAX customers and employees. It allows employees to enter the vehicles stock number to generate a QR code to be
printed out and placed in the car unique to the stock number. When employees and customers alike scan this QR code the app will present
whether the car is sellable, the price, and the mileage scraped from the CARMAX website.
